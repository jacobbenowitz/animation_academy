# **Background**
Welcome to Animation Academy! Learn about how to make a webpage interactive using the transition and animation CSS properties. CSS Animations make a web experiences engaging by selecting static HTML elements and changing their properties over a time, often in response to user input or actions. Your goal is to make this webpage interactive, just follow the prompts to polish this site up!

This demo is divided into 3 sections where each level will prompt you to type CSS code in order to progress to the bext level. The 3 sections are:

2. **transitions**
2. **animations**
3. **@keyframes**

The game will start nice and easy with `transitions`, assuming the user has no knowledge of CSS animation properties. It will start by teaching users how to transition an elementâ€™s state based on events like hover. The advanced section, `animations`, will teach users how to animate elements with percentage states, `@keyframes`, and further polish animations by smoothing them out.

This game will use Node.js, vanilla DOM manipulation, and webpack as the module bundler for the project. 

# **Functionality & MVPs**

**In the Animation Academy demo, users will be able to:**

- type CSS into an IDE that is applied to the DOM
- progress to the next level if the level prompt was completed successfully
- get a visual indicator that the prompt was not met
- click a button to get a hint if they are stuck
- code up animations to be used directly on the web page
